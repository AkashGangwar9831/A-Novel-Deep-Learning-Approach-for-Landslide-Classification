In this Reasearch Project, we have proposed an algorith which can classify images and videos of landslides. 
Our algorithm detects landslide with an accuracy of 96.90%. Proposed algorithm uses Convolutional Neural Network on the dataset.
The dataset consists of two classes one class is landslides and the other is non-landlides. Dataset contains a total of about 350 images.
